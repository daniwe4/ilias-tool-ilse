# **ilse** automatically builds ILIAS installations
**Proof of Concept for a Command Line Installation Script for [ILIAS](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS)**

*Please make sure you understand that this is not yet ready for production. Use this
at your own risk. This may also be shaky, as using the ILIAS setup from another
application is mostly try and error and sometimes also changes in stable versions.*

## Prerequisits

### Software requirements
* PHP 5.6 or higher (PHP 7 works since Release 5.2)
* git 2.1.4 or higher
* [ILIAS requirements](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/blob/trunk/docs/configuration/install.md)

### Installation
Download the PHAR for the latest release [here](https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/ilias-tool-ilse/releases).
These instructions assume that you make ilse executable as `ilse`.

## Usage

### Configuration
In order to let **ilse** install ILIAS for you, you need to create a configuration file
containing the required information for your installation.

```
ilse example-config
```

will give you an example configuration, which you will need to adjust to your requirements.

### Installation
After you created your configuration file, make **ilse** build an installation
from it:

```
ilse install $PATH_TO_CONFIG
```

You may also supply **ilse** with multiple config files. **ilse** will then prefer
entries from the latter over the former. This allows you to create basic config
files and overwrite only distinct config entries with more specific config files.

You may also use a config from a [config repo](https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/ilias-configs/public)
and only add your local folders and credentials, e.g.:

```
ilse install release_5-2 local.yaml
```

### Delete installation
If you got tired of your ILIAS installation, **ilse** will be happy to remove
it for you:

```
ilse delete $PATH_TO_CONFIG
```

## Outlook
**ilse** is in internal use at CaT for about a year now. It already contains
facilities to do some more stuff automatically:

* make some configurations (e.g. LDAP, SOAP, password requirements, ...)
* install plugins
* update the installation
* import content and org-structures
* create roles and users

At the moment we do not consider these to be stable enough to show them
to the public, thus only basic functionality is available for the cli interface
at the moment.

We also have the vision that someday some ILIAS configurations are provided
in a repository like [this one](https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/ilias-configs-public)
so that people who want to try ILIAS only need to configure some locations
on their system. This requirement will vanish as well, once [doil](https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/ilias-tool-doil)
or a similar tool works reliably. This project could also pen a huge space
for testing, manual as well as automatic.

We hope that in the future this or a similar tool will be the only, or at least one, 
official way to install ILIAS. 
For this, we will be happy to contribute our code and knowledge to the community.

## Contributions
We are not ready to take contributions to **ilse** in an organized way at the moment.
Please contact us via e-mail if you want to contribute code to the project, preferably
before you start your work.

We started cleanup and are also performing major internal changes to the code base 
at the moment. Once this is complete, we consider opening this project to outside 
contributions in a more structured way.
